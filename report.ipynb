    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Housing is something that everyone needs and houses come at a high cost. While it is possible to hire real estate agents to look for houses for you, it can often cost tens of thousands of dollars, money that could be spent on buying an even better house. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our final project, we wanted to collect and analyze existing house data and ultimately build a tool that can predict the price of a house given some features of the house. Initially, we wanted to be able to predict house prices anywhere in the U.S. However, due to some constraints we will explain in more detail below, we have narrowed our project down to predicting house prices in Pittsburgh."

    "### Initial Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first thought of the project, we decided that there are two major components to the success of this project:\n",
    "1. Finding appropriate features and collecting those data, and\n",
    "2. Coming up with a good model that will give the highest accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the features, after much brainstorming, we decided that these aspects would have the greatest influence on a house's price:\n",
    "- location of the house (which we will convert to longitude and latitude to locate the house easily)\n",
    "- square footage of a house, since larger properties should cost more\n",
    "- number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms to get a sense of the structure of the house\n",
    "- the year the house is built, to determine the age of the house\n",
    "- the convenience of the house, measured by the number of restaurants and shops near by\n",
    "- the quality of the neighborhood, measured by the crime rate and the poverty level\n",
    "- education level of the neighborhood, also used to assess the quality of the area\n",
    "- median household income of the area, again, to assess quality\n",
    "- demand of houses in the city, since the greater the demand, the higher price a house can be sold for\n",
    "- house type, since apartments are generally cheaper than houses and\n",
    "- floor of the property (for apartments), since higher floor will result in better view and lower noise\n",
    "\n",
    "For our models, we decided to try out a few different ones (<a href=\"#knn\">K Nearest Neighbors</a>, <a href=\"#lr\">Linear Regression</a>, and <a href=\"nn\">Neural Network</a>) to see which one would be the best. We also decided to try out a <a href=\"median\">Median/Mean Predictor</a> to see how well our models perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "K nearest neighbors was the first model that came to mind, as we felt like a good way to judge a house's price is to look at its' neighbors prices. Expanding on that idea, we concluded that houses that are very similar to each other (in terms of location, newness, size, etc) must have similar prices. Thus, K nearest neighbors was a natural candidate for our problem and we had very high hopes about its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression was another promising model, as it was very easy for us to imagine how a house price would change given a change in some feature. For example, it is intuitive that in general, a house that is larger (higher square footage) would be more expensive than a house that is smaller and a house that is newer (more aesthetically pleasing or safer) would be more expensive than a house that is older.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network was another model we wanted to play with, as is so versatile and we were curious about how well it would perform on a problem like this. We imagined the network to have a hidden layer that could detect features that was hard for visualize (such as a certain block of houses having higher prices) based on features we collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have decided on features and models, it was time to collect the data."

    "\n",
    "Collecting the necessary data was, in our opinion, the most difficult part of this project (explained below). We looked through numerous sources online to try to find a single source that could provide us with everythin we need, but as expected, we did not find such a source. After a long time of searching, we found <a href=\"https://homes.com\">homes.com</a>. It provides information about estimated price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and the year the house was built."

    "### House Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*_Note: homes.com has changed since the time we collected the data and recorded the project video. Since the website changed, our scraper would not work anymore, but the idea behind the scraper is the same and it would be trivial to adapt our scraper to collect information from the new site. You can see from our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7BmG6g74oPo?t=19s\">project video</a> what the URL https://www.homes.com/property/125-40th-st-pittsburgh-pa-15201/id-400022876636/ used to look like._\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it seemed like homes.com was perfect for the project as it exceeded our expectations of how much detail we could obtain from each individual house. We planned on scraping every house that exist on homes.com (well over 100,000 entries) to build our nationwide house price predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we started writing the program to scrape data, we quickly ran into a major problem. The information we wanted to scrape are all generated by JavaScript, so simply getting the HTML would not result in any useful information. Viewing the source of the example page above would just show junk.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we used a webdriver from <a href=\"http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/\">selenium</a> to mimic a browser and load the JavaScript generated portions to get the useful data. Thus, we went from using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    url = 'https://www.homes.com/property/125-40th-st-pittsburgh-pa-15201/id-400022876636/'\n",
    "    r = request.get(url)\n",
    "    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser)\n",
    "    # find the useful information\n",
    "    house_info_section = soup.find(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n",
    "    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n",
    "    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n",
    "    \n",
    "    url = 'https://www.homes.com/property/125-40th-st-pittsburgh-pa-15201/id-400022876636/'\n",
    "    # initiates browser driver\n",
    "    driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n",
    "    driver.get(url)\n",
    "    # wait for the secion to be generated before fetching the information\n",
    "    house_info_section = WebDriverWait(driver, time_out).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.XPATH, '...')))\n",
    "    \n",
    "As you might have sensed by now, waiting for the JavaScript to load everything is significantly slower than just fetching the HTML; it takes about 4 to 5 seconds to connect to the page, load the information, and detect the information using the webdriver. To make the problem worse, sometimes, the site loads advertisements before the useful information, causing the process to take well over 15 seconds. We managed to deal with the advertisement problem by setting a timeout of 5 seconds when loading the information. If the webdriver cannot find the information 5 seconds after connecting, we move on to the next page. This cut our cost down to about 4.5 seconds per webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered running the program on multiple computers to collect all the information, but it would still take about a week to collect everything. Hence, we decided to limit our scope to Pittsburgh and collected 100 random entries from each zip code in Pittsburgh, ending up with about 4000 entries. The code for scraping from homes.com is located in src/homes-scraper.py."

For most of the models, the default training chunk was 80% of the data and the validating chunk was the remaining 20%. For all our models, we decided to measure the error rate by using absolute percent error. We use absolute because we do not want an overestimate and an underestimate to cancel each other out, and we use percent error since house prices vary. For example, if a house is actually worth \\$100,000 and we predict \\$143,000, this would be a 43% error. Similarly, if we predicted \\$57,000, this would also be a 43% error. \n",

The features we used including square feet, poverty rate, education attainment, year built and amenity index which is calculated by the sum of number of restaurants nearly scaled by their average rating and the number of stores scaled by their average rating. We tested severals ways to construct the amenity index, however, the result was less than satisfying. The best we could get use the fourmula described above and the correlation coefficent against the price per sqft is about 0.25."

With k-fold validation, the mean absoluate percentage error increased to 38%. This is expected because during our feature engineering phase, we found that most of the features we have are more strongly correlated with price per sqft than with price. For instance, the correlation coefficient of price per sqft against newness (newness = (data built - 1850) ^ 2) is 0.501 while price against newness is 0.401"

    "The last model we used was a neural network with two hidden layers, implemented using keras. First, we thought about whether to categorize the label into ranges (< \\$80,000, \\$80,000 - \\$100,000, etc) or leave it as continuous. Since we have used a categorizing neural network in the deep learning section of homework 5, we decided to challenge ourselves a little and leave the output as continuous. Ideally, we would like the nodes in the hidden layer to learn different aspects about the training data. For example, a certain block might have houses that are more expensive. When a testing entries provides the network with a house that is in that block, a certain node would be triggered and return a higher price as the final answer. Since with 2 hidden layers, the network is no longer linear, so we decided to use the coordinates of a house instead of features of a neighborhood."

    "Although the performance of the network is not as good as we had hoped for, we think that it is justified. First of all, we only have about 4000 collected entries and only 80% of those are used to train the network. With only about 100 houses collected per zip code, it would be very hard for the network to learn a lot of the underlying information. Moreover, it is difficult for us to reason about how many underlying features the network can pick up on. Even though we have tried adjusting the number of hidden nodes and the number of hidden layers, it is hard for us to try out more structures that could produce better estimates."

    "\n",
    "Overall, we think that the project is a success. We managed to create a model that can predict house prices with about 27% error, which is far less than the 63% gotten from the mean predictor. Just as we thought, k nearest neighbors had the highest accuracy. In conclusion, each model had its own advantages and disadvantages. Linear regression was simple to visualize but it was hard to take into account other useful features. K nearest neighbors gave the highest accuracy but was by far the slowest for predicting. The neural network was very easy to implement, but it is difficult to explain why some houses are more expensive."

    "There are many improvements we can make to our project and we will discuss a few important ones below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can collect more features for each house and more houses overall. Due to some time constraints, we only collected data on about 4000 houses. With more features and more data, all of our models will be able to predict at higher accuracies, especially the linear regression model and the neural network.\n",
    "2. We can eliminate outliers from our training data. We thought of using the linear regression to detect outliers in the training example and eliminating them before feeding the training data into the other models, but we felt like this was cheating, as the other models use similar features. We could look into other ways of detecting outliers and eliminating them. This will improve the accracies of all of our models as well.\n",
    "3. Since homes.com did not provide accurate house types, we assumed that all of the listings are houses and not apartments, townhouses, duplexes, etc. We could come up with a way of determining whether an address is of an apartment or a house and we think that this could increase our accuracies significantly. However, given our limited amount of data, further spliting them into different house types would result in too little data for each house type."
